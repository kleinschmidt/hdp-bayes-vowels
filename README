HDP-BAYES-VOWELS

Ultimately, this will be an implementation of Feldman et al.'s (2009) hierarchical DP model of phonetic/lexical learning.

Right now, it's some warm-up stuff:
  finiteNormMixtureGibbs.r -- Gibbs sampler for a FMM Gaussian model of arbitrary dimensions
  dpNormMixtureGibbs.r -- Gibbs sampler for a DP Guassian Mixture model
